                        <p>On our late morning dive trip we visit two shallow reefs average depth of 40â€™ (12m) where we will find tons of reef fish (25% of which are endemic to Hawaii), eels, octopus, turtles, rays and even dolphins! If you are not certified you can join our Discover Scuba Diving program. In this program you will learn the basics of diving before an instructor takes you out in the ocean. There are medical requirements for diving, if you have questions, please call to discuss this before you book.</p>
                        <p>Please note: Minimum age is 12 years old. A certain amount of physical fitness is required for diving, please call to discuss your particular circumstances before booking. Please allow at least 18 hours after diving before flying.</p>

                        <p>Join us for our Discover Scuba Diving program and learn the basic safety guidelines and skills needed to scuba dive. Our introductory dives are small groups led by an instructor who's primary focus is your safety, comfort, and enjoyment. Large groups of people spook wildlife, we choose not to fill our boat to capacity to ensure the best possible experience.</p>
                        <p>Have fun swimming around and exploring while putting those key skills to use with an instructor on a shallow reef dive.   While not a scuba certification course, Discover Scuba Diving is a quick and easy introduction to what it takes to explore the underwater world This is a 10 a.m. check in at our boat with an approximate 2:00 p.m. return time.</p>
